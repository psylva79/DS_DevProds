## Course Project

This is markdown is part of the assignment for the course Developing Data Products integrated in the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

Instructions:

1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

## How to use the application

Using the data on credit ratings provided by ISLR package, I fit a linear model to predict an individual rating. Gender, ethnicity, income, account balance, and education are used as input variables. 

The application is running on (https://psylva79.shinyapps.io/credit/). The user may introduce his/her data and find an estimate of the corresponding credit score.


## Credit Dataset

The data used in the app comes from the Credit dataset. Below are some summary statistics:


```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(ISLR)
library(tidyverse)
data(Credit)


```

```{r}
summary(Credit)
```

## Predictive model

```{r}
Credit <- Credit %>% 
  select(-ID, -Limit, -Cards) %>% 
  mutate(Gender = factor(str_replace(Gender, " ", ""), levels = c("Male", "Female")))

model <- Credit %>%  lm(Rating ~ ., data= .)

broom::tidy(model)
```
